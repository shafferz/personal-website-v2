# Biography

Hello world! My name is Zachary Shaffer, and I am a student researcher pursuing an undergraduate degree at Allegheny College.
I am majoring in computer science and minoring in communication arts. The majority of the work in my minor is dedicated to the
production and direction of film. In my time studying computer science, I have developed an interest in researching data security,
cyber security, and information security. My personal passion, however, lies in game design and video game development.

My dream is to work in a field where computer science is met by human interaction. The passion I have for video game development
comes from my love of storytelling and entertainment, and a desire to captivate an audience using film techniques with my programming
skill.
