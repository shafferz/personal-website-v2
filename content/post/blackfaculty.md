## Part 1 - Faculty Diversity

The racial diversity representation at Allegheny College is far less than the
national averages of other institutions for black, Asian, and Hispanic faculty.
Furthermore, the black experience at Allegheny College for faculty and students
alike is comes with its own unique challenges.

Kristin Dukes, the Dean for Institutional Diversity, met with me to help me
better understand where Allegheny College stands in terms of hiring more black
faculty members. In our discussion, we explored exactly how diverse Allegheny's
faculty is, where we stand in relation to other schools, what the college is
doing to hire more faculty of color, and why hiring more black faculty is a
deceptively daunting task.

Evidenced by the headlining image, Allegheny's faculty is primarily white. In
fall of 2017, there were 169 full-time faculty members, of which 139 are neither
faculty of color not international faculty. To see just how Allegheny stacks up,
consider the percentages of white faculty in comparison to faculty of other
racial backgrounds.

Although behind the national average in every way, Allegheny has different
standards for comparing itself to other institutions. Allegheny reports based
on its standard comparison group (SCG), a group of schools deemed by the college
to be similar to Allegheny in size and climate to guide institutional policy
decisions. This standard comparison group is currently being reviewed, but is
the same as is
[currently listed](https://sites.allegheny.edu/institutionalresearch/surveys/)
on the Allegheny website. By all found accounts, Allegheny College is on par
with the other schools in its SCG.

## Part 2 - Effects of (the lack of) Faculty Representation

> We need support. Who are we supposed to go to? To look up to?
>
>—<cite>Brianna Watson, '19</cite>

Regardless of how Allegheny stacks up with its similar schools, however,
students of color feel a lack of support and a need for a more racially
diverse faculty. Brianna Watson, class of 2019, said in an interview that there
isn't enough support for students of color. "Any student of color, black,
Asian, Hispanic... who are they supposed to lean on for support?" Reconsider the
headline image of this article. Can you identify all of the black faculty or
staff members?

## Part 3 - Black Faculty at Allegheny College

This sentiment is also echoed by the faculty itself — in the 2009 Biennial
Report of the Diversity and Gender Equity Committee, faculty were surveyed with
a series of questions from the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI),
wherein they were asked, on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly
agree) how much they agree that "this institution should hire more faculty of
color." The response was overwhelming in favor of agree, with an overall
faculty average of 3.2. Furthermore, Kristin Dukes, during our interview, told
me that the College is actively engaged in efforts to hire more faculty of
color.

Students want and need Allegheny College to hire more faculty of color. While
the diversity in faculty is overall lacking, there is a distinct absence of
black faculty. Of the six faces highlighted in the infographic above, five of
them are faculty. Of the five, only four are full-time at Allegheny. Half of
those four are tenured — leaving the remaining two black faculty in limbo with
regard to their tenure status. The below graphic provides more information about
these faculty and staff members.

## Part 4 - The Challenge of Hiring Black Faculty

Not only is the lack of a black faculty presence apparent, but there is a
particularly unique challenge when it comes to finding black faculty. While the
college is actively seeking more faculty of color (and specifically black
faculty), Kristin Dukes pointed out that the black experience in Meadville comes
with triggers unique to black faculty. Noting an educational, socioeconomic, and
racial divide, Dukes noted how difficult it is for black faculty to find the
"creature comforts" that any person would need: social interactions, food, and
sunshine. She described Meadville as a insular community that you need to break
into in order to be comfortable. And even once that happens, there will still
be encounters and times when living in Meadville as a black professor is
particularly difficult.

> I met someone who said I am a 'clean and classy black,' so I must not be from
around here. Another time, after telling someone I worked at Allegheny, I was
told that if I was cleaning staff, I 'should work at Edinboro, it's a better
job.'
>
> —<cite>Kristin Dukes</cite>

To come to Meadville and to come to Allegheny College are the same actions. It
is often the common misconception that the city of Meadville and the campus of
Allegheny College are in different realms, but the simple fact of the matter is
that Meadville and the college are one in the same. If you drive onto campus
from town via North Main Street, and continue driving on that road, you transfer
from Meadville to Allegheny College and from Allegheny College to West Mead in
a matter of moments. Combine this with the fact that local bars have counter
tops decorated with confederate flags made of pennies and walls adorning the
'stars and bars,' an active local chapter of the Ku Klos Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, and a city population that is at most five percent black, and the
immediate deterrents for black faculty to come to Allegheny become clear.

Furthermore, Allegheny is not going to hire black faculty for the sake of having
more black faculty. Dukes stated it clearly: "I'd sooner hire ten white folks
who have equity in mind over a single black candidate isn't equity-minded." As
standard hiring process, every applicant must include a diversity statement,
intended to assess each candidate's dedication to creating an equitable
environment or putting in the work necessary to facilitate a diverse campus.
Even once a person of color is hired as a new faculty member, though, other
factors must be considered for the mental and emotional health of the newly
hired.

## Part 5 - Hiring Black Faculty is Hard; Retaining Black Faculty is Harder

As if finding a black faculty member who is willing to come to Meadville, PA,
and make an honest attempt at joining this community as an instructor wasn't
difficult enough, there's still one major issue for the newly hired: retention.
Allegheny College has historically struggled to retain faculty of color. In
the 2009 Biennial Report of the Diversity and Gender Equity Committee, it is
reported that **zero** percent of faculty of color hired between 1993 and 1998
were retained by 2009, and two out of three of the faculty of color hired in
1999/2000 were retained. That is a total loss of 75% of all faculty of color
hired from 1993-2000 by the year 2009. This is the most recent, complete set of
data available to me at this time for historic faculty of color retention data.

What makes the retention of black faculty so difficult? Well, aside from the
aforementioned factors such as lacking a safe social environment, there are
other factors such as a lack of support for black faculty and a high volume of
demand for support from black faculty for black students. Since there are so
few black professors in general, black professors often have to outsource
receiving support in their instructing roles from external contacts at other
universities. Black faculty must also rely heavily on the support of their
white allies on the faculty as they make the transition into this new,
relatively hostile environment.

Not only do the black professors need support, but they also act as magnets to
a support system that is desperately sought after by students. Many people
believe that if faculty of color is hired, they will immediately be ready to
enter the role of supporting students, or that they will even be interested in
doing the work necessary to create this support. It is a common narrative that
the faculty of color leave Allegheny because the school is unwelcoming, but
other factors such as lack of support and the harsh environment ultimately end
up being what drives most of them away.

## Part 6 - Conclusion

> For any POC faculty moving in, if you're willing to stand steadfast, this
place can get better. It's not wonderful now, but it can get better.
>
> —<cite>Kristin Dukes</cite>

At the end of the day, regardless of perception, Allegheny College is making a
distinct, concerted effort to hire more black faculty members. In years past,
there has been a program which has run in iterations called the Diversity
Scholar in Residence. It has been revived this year, and revived with a focus on
hiring more faculty of color and providing the support they need to stay. The
program includes additional layers of mentoring at the departmental, collegiate,
and external levels, features decreased teaching loads for incumbent faculty of
color (reduction from a 3-3 to a 2-2 [2-2 means 2 courses in fall and 2 courses
in spring]) with the same opportunities as professors with higher loads,
reviving faculty of color meet-and-greets, and more. But there are many factors
that make this task difficult, even beyond what I have mentioned already (for
example, competing with R1 research schools to hire the same candidates with
less money to offer).

While there is a long way to go, it seems pretty clear
that Kristin Dukes and Allegheny College are making an honest effort to increase
the faculty diversity, especially with black professors, and is doing what it
can to work within the goals of the college. As Dukes said in our interview,
"We want to find the right people willing to dig in, take a couple of bruises,
and support the overall goals of the college."
