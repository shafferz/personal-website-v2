Kristin Dukes, the Dean for Institutional Diversity, met with me to help me
better understand where Allegheny College stands in terms of hiring more black
faculty members. In our discussion, we explored exactly how diverse Allegheny's
faculty is, where we stand in relation to other schools, what the college is
doing to hire more faculty of color, and why hiring black faculty is a unique
challenge.

Evidenced by the headlining image, Allegheny's faculty is primarily white. In
fall of 2017, there were 169 full-time faculty members, of which 139 neither
faculty of color not international faculty.
