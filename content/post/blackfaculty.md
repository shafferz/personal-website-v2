The ethnic diversity representation at Allegheny College is far less than the
national averages of other institutions for black, Asian, and Hispanic faculty.
Furthermore, the black experience at Allegheny College for faculty and students
alike is comes with its own unique challenges.

Kristin Dukes, the Dean for Institutional Diversity, met with me to help me
better understand where Allegheny College stands in terms of hiring more black
faculty members. In our discussion, we explored exactly how diverse Allegheny's
faculty is, where we stand in relation to other schools, what the college is
doing to hire more faculty of color, and why hiring more black faculty is a
deceptively daunting task.

Evidenced by the headlining image, Allegheny's faculty is primarily white. In
fall of 2017, there were 169 full-time faculty members, of which 139 neither
faculty of color not international faculty.
