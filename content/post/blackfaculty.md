Diversity</cite>

The ethnic diversity representation at Allegheny College is far less than the
national averages of other institutions for black, Asian, and Hispanic faculty.
Furthermore, the black experience at Allegheny College for faculty and students
alike is comes with its own unique challenges.

Kristin Dukes, the Dean for Institutional Diversity, met with me to help me
better understand where Allegheny College stands in terms of hiring more black
faculty members. In our discussion, we explored exactly how diverse Allegheny's
faculty is, where we stand in relation to other schools, what the college is
doing to hire more faculty of color, and why hiring more black faculty is a
deceptively daunting task.

Evidenced by the headlining image, Allegheny's faculty is primarily white. In
fall of 2017, there were 169 full-time faculty members, of which 139 are neither
faculty of color not international faculty. To see just how Allegheny stacks up,
consider the percentages of white faculty in comparison to faculty of other
ethnic backgrounds.

Although behind the national average in every way, Allegheny has different
standards for comparing itself to other institutions. Allegheny reports based
on its standard comparison group (SCG), a group of schools deemed by the college
to be similar to Allegheny in size and climate to guide institutional policy
decisions. This standard comparison group is currently being reviewed, but is
the same as is
[currently listed](https://sites.allegheny.edu/institutionalresearch/surveys/)
on the Allegheny website. By all found accounts, Allegheny College is on par
with the other schools in its SCG.

> We need support. Who are we supposed to go to? To look up to? —<cite>Brianna Watson, '19</cite>

Regardless of how Allegheny stacks up with its similar schools, however,
students of color feel a lack of support and a need for a more ethnically
diverse faculty. Brianna Watson, class of 2019, said in an interview that there
isn't enough support for students of color. "Any student of color, black,
Asian, Hispanic... who are they supposed to lean on for support?" Reconsider the
headline image of this article. Can you identify all of the black faculty or
staff members?

This sentiment is also echoed by the faculty itself — in the 2009 Biennial
Report of the Diversity and Gender Equity Committee, faculty were surveyed with
a series of questions from the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI),
wherein they were asked, on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly
agree) how much they agree that "this institution should hire more faculty of
color." The response was overwhelming in favor of agree, with an overall
faculty average of 3.2. Furthermore, Kristin Dukes, during our interview, told
me that the College is actively engaged in efforts to hire more faculty of
color.

Students want and need Allegheny College to hire more faculty of color. While
the diversity in faculty is overall lacking, there is a distinct absence of
black faculty. Of the six faces highlighted in the infographic above, five of
them are faculty. Of the five, only four are full-time at Allegheny. Half of
those four are tenured — leaving the remaining two black faculty in limbo with
regard to their tenure status. The below graphic provides more information about
these faculty and staff members.

Not only is the lack of a black faculty presence apparent, but there is a
particularly unique challenge when it comes to finding black faculty. While the
college is actively seeking more faculty of color (and specifically black
faculty), Kristin Dukes pointed out that the black experience in Meadville comes
with "triggers unique to black faculty."
