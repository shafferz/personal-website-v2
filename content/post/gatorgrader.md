In the early half of my final semester at Allegheny College, I had the
opportunity to work on a project called GatorGrader. GatorGrader, a tool
designed to help students know when they have satisfied the requirements of a
given lab assignment on GitHub, is an open-source software developed by students
at Allegheny College. You can check out the project
[here](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).
