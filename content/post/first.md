# <p align="center">Hobby or Career: Is Video Game Development Viable as a Career Option? </p>

Video game development has been, for as long as I can remember, one of my greatest passions in computer science. In fact, my very first programming experience was developing a small series of (mind you, *very* bad) video games for websites like Newgrounds and Kongregate. I remember sitting at our home computer, following YouTube tutorials for making my own games in Macromedia (now Adobe) Flash using ActionScript. Admittedly, I did not learn a lot of programming skill, but I did make *functional* games using what I had at my disposal.

My first video game was a simple game called *Kongregate Chatting on the side*. The goal of the game was to give you something mindless to do while chatting with your friends on the built-in site-wide chat service that is next to every game on the website. In the game, you killed a stick man by clicking buttons with various modes of death, and a pitiful, sub-par animation would play in about four to ten frames of the stick man (hereby referred to as Bob, which was his name). Bob had many sad, tragic ends, such as death by axes, overwhelming forces of gravity, implosions and explosions, and even a bomb. This game was, without denial, possibly **the worst game that has ever disgraced the face of the Internet.** I can say that now, but at the time, I was a very proud twelve-year-old developer in the making. The comment section also praised me for my hard work, with many inspirational lines of encouragement:

> * Best game EVAH! And because being number 1 is the best.. I give you a 1/5! CONGRATS!
> * It is soo not a game and if it was it would be suckish like yo' face!
> * -sigh- One star.
> * FIRST

...Okay, so maybe the comments were a little less forgiving than I remembered. But, surely, after I brushed up on my skills and developed a single-level maze game with a hand-drawn map consisting of a single path, the Internet rejoiced. Right? I mean, the reception for the grand debut of *Maze Game* couldn't have been too bad...

> * Yes..at least it works... 2
> * Um...needless to say, a one.
> * Only one level, to cheat with right-click is possible, poor graphics. 1/5
> * best part is the loading screen
